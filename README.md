# textar: TEXTual ARchive

Package textar encodes a file list (key-value slice) into a human editable text file and vice versa.
This is inspired by https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/txtar but this format can encode any content without issues.
See https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ypsu/textar for the documentation.

Note: this project uses https://ypsu.github.io/featver as its versioning scheme.
The project will enter the more stable v1 version only when it has users already.
