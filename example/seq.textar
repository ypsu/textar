This example runs `seq` in various ways and captures the output.

== seq 2 3
2
3

== seq -s. 8 2 12
8.10.12

== # Comment.
There's no restriction what the filename can be other than it cannot contain a newline.
You could implement a logic that ignores # entries and you can then use that for mid-data comments.

== seq -w 8 12
08
09
10
11
12
